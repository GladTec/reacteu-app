For some use cases, yes, but our components don't quite work as well as the native counterparts (some would consider this to be a heinous understatement). I'll give you some background here on what ListViews are, where I've personally run into problems, why they are hard, and what optimizations are currently being done. I hope that afterwards you'll feel more confident building your own list views and contributing to discussions.","length":30,"tags":"","status":1,"uuid":"","agree_to_coc":true,"type":0,"start_date":"2016-06-03T13:30:00Z","created_at":"2016-04-11T18:13:57Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T18:14:27Z","deleted_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","comments":null,"likes":0,"event_id":28,"speakers":[{"id":409,"name":"Brent Vatne","twitter":"notbrent","github":"brentvatne","url":"http://brentvatne.ca/","past_experience":"","email":"brent@exponentjs.com","bio":"Front-end web/mobile developer working on Exponent (exponentjs.com) and one of React Native top committers.","uuid":"825c481a-d443-4336-8136-a3c9d69ecb6a","status":1,"avatar_url":"https://api.eventlama.com/avatars/events/28/speakers/409/avatar.png","travel_costs":false,"agree_to_coc":false,"created_at":"2016-04-11T18:13:57Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T18:13:57Z","deleted_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","display_order":0,"event_id":28,"proposal_id":389}]},{"id":390,"title":"GraphQL Future","description":"nc","length":30,"tags":"","status":1,"uuid":"","agree_to_coc":true,"type":0,"start_date":"2016-06-03T14:00:00Z","created_at":"2016-04-11T18:17:01Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T18:19:28Z","deleted_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","comments":null,"likes":0,"event_id":28,"speakers":[{"id":410,"name":"Lee Byron","twitter":"leeb","github":"leebyron","url":"","past_experience":"","email":"leeb@fb.com","bio":"Making things at Facebook since 2008: React, GraphQL, Immutable.js, Mobile, JavaScript.","uuid":"f6fc737f-4146-4d29-bae8-240e9d462b23","status":1,"avatar_url":"https://api.eventlama.com/avatars/events/28/speakers/410/avatar.png","travel_costs":false,"agree_to_coc":false,"created_at":"2016-04-11T18:17:01Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T18:17:01Z","deleted_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","display_order":0,"event_id":28,"proposal_id":390},{"id":411,"name":"Laney Kuenzel","twitter":"laneykuenzel","github":"laneyk","url":"http://www.slideshare.net/LaneyKuenzel","past_experience":"","email":"laney@fb.com","bio":"Software engineer at Facebook Boston working on subscriptions in GraphQL.","uuid":"6483e8e2-5ae9-48a2-a2b7-ac61eda824f6","status":1,"avatar_url":"https://api.eventlama.com/avatars/events/28/speakers/411/avatar.png","travel_costs":false,"agree_to_coc":false,"created_at":"2016-04-11T18:18:42Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T18:18:42Z","deleted_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","display_order":0,"event_id":28,"proposal_id":0}]},{"id":398,"title":"Coffee Break","description":"Socialize, have some coffee or other drinks.","length":30,"tags":"","status":1,"uuid":"","agree_to_coc":false,"type":2,"start_date":"2016-06-03T14:30:00Z","created_at":"2016-04-11T18:31:19Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T00:31:17Z","deleted_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","comments":null,"likes":0,"event_id":28,"speakers":null},{"id":200,"title":"Progressive enhancement for mobile apps: exploring the continuum between web apps and React Native","description":"Rather than looking at web apps and React Native as two separate technologies that mobile developers have to choose between, these approaches can be seen as part of a continuum that allows for progressive enhancement. It should be possible to build apps from a shared codebase that work out of the box on both desktop and mobile devices, but that can be iterated on to get you all the way to a fully native user experience for the parts where this makes sense.\n\nThe React programming model is especially suited for this, both because of its focus on composability, and because it has shown that a JavaScript UI framework does not have to be dependent on the DOM. This talk will explore how this model makes it possible to reuse components between web and native platforms, and may even allow for ways to seamlessly mix native views and web elements within a single component tree. It will also discuss ongoing work on establishing a common API surface for accessing device-native features.","length":30,"tags":"reactjs, reactnative, mobile, cordova","status":1,"uuid":"","agree_to_coc":false,"type":0,"start_date":"2016-06-03T15:00:00Z","created_at":"2016-01-18T16:20:47Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T00:47:37Z","deleted_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","comments":null,"likes":0,"event_id":28,"speakers":[{"id":205,"name":"Martijn Walraven","twitter":"martijnwalraven","github":"martijnwalraven","url":"","past_experience":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHbmqTiTKRg","email":"martijnwalraven@meteor.com","bio":"Martijn Walraven is a core developer at Meteor Development Group, where he works on mobile support for the Meteor JavaScript app platform, including the Cordova integration.
